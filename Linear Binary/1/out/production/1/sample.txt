Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the "Hitman," is one of India's most celebrated cricketers.
 Born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, he has established himself as a formidable opening batsman
 across all formats of the game. His ability to score big, especially in One Day Internationals
 (ODIs), is unmatched—he holds the record for the highest individual score in an ODI, an astonishing
  264 runs. Rohit is also the only player to have scored three double centuries in ODIs, a feat
  that showcases his dominance with the bat. His leadership skills came to the forefront when he
   captained Mumbai Indians to multiple Indian Premier League (IPL) titles, making him one of
   the most successful IPL captains. In international cricket, he has led India to victories in major tournaments,
   including the 2024 T20 World Cup. His elegant stroke play, particularly his pull shot, is admired by fans and experts alike.
 Rohit has amassed over 12,000 runs in T20 cricket, joining an elite list of players.
 His consistency and ability to perform under pressure make him a vital asset to the Indian team.
 As he continues to break records, his legacy as one of cricket’s greatest batsmen remains firmly intact.
